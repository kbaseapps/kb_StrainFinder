description : |
  <p>Strain Finder v1 takes as input a reference genome and a Reads Library.  It aligns the reads to the reference genome to find SNPs in the reads, then finds maximum likelihood estimates for the strain genotypes and the strain frequencies.  It outputs Genome objects, one per Strain mode.  The inferred relative abundance of each Strain can be found in the <i>Summary</i> section of the Report.  The SNPs found are also given in the Report.</p>
